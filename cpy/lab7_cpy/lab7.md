# Lab7 - Practice the build process using make/makefile utility

## Subjects
  - writing makefiles in different forms 
  - making archive files - libsort.a 

## Getting Started
  - files provided
    - sortDriver.cpp comparator.cpp, printlist.cpp - fully coded source code provided
    - bubble.cpp, quick.cpp - Modify the code such it works __in descending order as well__ or copy these files from your previous homework. In conclusion, add a comparator function pointer argument in quicksort algorithm. 
    - staticlib.pdf - for your reference

## Step 1: Follow the "Build Process" lecture 
  - Follow the "Build Process" lecture first; Then, 
  - Produce the following make files and make sure that each script works as expected.
    - makefile
    - make.1
    - make.2
    - make.3
    - make.libsort
  - __As you progress, you may turn on/off #if 1/0 in bubble.cpp and quick.cpp as necessary. It depends on what you are building.__

  ```
  Happy Coding~~
  ```
----------------------------
## File(s) to submit for this Lab:
    Submit the following files. Some penality may apply if you submit the script that does not work. 
    - makefile
    - make.1
    - make.2
    - make.3
    - make.libsort
    - sortDriver.exe            # descending should work here  
    - qsort.exe                 # descending should work here
    - libsort.a
