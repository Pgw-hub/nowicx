 /*
 * This program implements a recurisve binarysearch():
 *
 * The binary search algorithm is a method of searching a sorted array for a single
 * element by cutting the array in half with each recursive pass.The trick is to
 * pick a midpoint near the center of the array, compare the data at that point
 * with the data being searched and then responding to one of three possible
 * conditions : the data is found at the midpoint, the data at the midpoint is
 * greater than the data being searched for, or the data at the midpoint is less
 * than the data being searched for.
 * Recursion is used in this algorithm because with each pass a new array is
 * created by cutting the old one in half.The binary search procedure is then
 * called recursively, this time on the new (and smaller) array.
 * Typically, the array's size is adjusted by manipulating a beginning and
 * ending index. The algorithm exhibits a logarithmic order of growth because
 * it essentially divides the problem domain in half with each pass.
 *
 * In this example, you need an extra function at user's convenience since a
 * user may want to simply call the function with three parameters such as
 * binarysearch(data, key, size).  Once you get the user's initial call,
 * then you call binarysearch(data, key, low, high) recursively.

 * int binarysearch(int *list, int key, int lo, int hi)
 * implements a recursive binary search algorithm.
 * INPUT:
 *		*list is a array of integers SORTED in ASCENDING order,
 *		key is the integer to search for, lo is the minimum
 *      array index, hi is the maximum array index
 * OUTPUT:
 *		returns the array index of `key` in the list' if found.
 *		otherwise returns a modified index where it could be found.
 * NOTE:
 * If the key is not found, lo is the insertion point where a key would be
 * inserted to maintain the order of the list.  It is more useful to return
 * the insertion point than -1.  The method must return a negative value to
 * indicate that the key is not in the list. Can it simply return -lo? No.
 * If key is less than list[0], lo would be 0. -0 is 0. This would indicate
 * that key matches list[0]. A good choice is to let the method return -lo-1
 * if the key is not in the list. Returning -lo-1 indicate not only that key
 * is not in the list, but also where the key would be inserted.
